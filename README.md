This data set has 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

The mice have a 50/50 distribution of female versus male. The drug regimens are Capomulin, Centamin, Infuninol, Ketapril, Naftisol, Placebo, Propriva, Ramiane, Stelasyn, and Zoniferol. Ramicane and Capomulin have the about the same number of mice for each treatment. The final tumor volume of Ramicne and Capomulin is both pretty low but Ramicane is lower. This might shows Ramicne might be even than Capomlin in treating tumors, but more research needs to be done to make a good conclusion. A research focused just on Ramicne and Capomulin with more mice.
